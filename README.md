# ZD-Agent-Helper
A Chrome Extension to remind ZenDesk Agents to associate Requestors with Organizations.\
\
When there is no Organization associated with the Requestor on the active Ticket, ZD Agent Helper highlights the nav bar and the 'create' button to call the Agent's attention.\
\
No configuration needed!\
